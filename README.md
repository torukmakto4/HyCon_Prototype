# HyCon_Prototype

Project Hy-Con: a large format, high-envelopment flywheel system for launching nerf darts,
using a groove profile family based on the hydrostatic contact principle.
This is the minimalist test cage used to verify the geometry worked before designing anything further.
As such, there are no mounting features and little packaging to speak of, some sharp things are not radiused,
and motor wiring orientation is not where you want it for a blaster, and the like.

This is designed around Turnigy Multistar V-Spec 2205 2350kv motors.

The flywheel model included is the original 9.5mm groove radius version and does 170-190fps.
More versions for changing velocity, and tuning to different ammo in the future along with cages meant for actual use.
