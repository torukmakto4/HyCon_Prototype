# HyCon_Prototype

Project Hy-Con: a large format, high-envelopment flywheel system for launching nerf darts,
using a groove profile family based on the hydrostatic contact principle.
This is the minimalist test cage used to verify the geometry worked before designing anything further.
As such, there are no mounting features and little packaging to speak of, some sharp things are not radiused,
and motor wiring orientation is not where you want it for a blaster, and the like.

The cage is split down the center of the bore to be more 3D printable. The cage and bore_cover components
must be bonded together with Devcon Plastic Welder or equivalent, being very careful of bore alignment
and removing excess adhesive.

This is designed around Turnigy Multistar V-Spec 2205 2350kv motors. M3 and M2.5 cap screws are required for assembly.
Be mindful of screw length near the motor windings!

Run the motors on controllers rated for at least 20A and a 3S battery.

The flywheel model included is the original 9.5mm groove radius version and does 170-190fps.
More versions for changing velocity, and tuning to different ammo in the future along with cages meant for actual use.
